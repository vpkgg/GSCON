Just a little file explaining how placeholder text and images are used in the website. 

Firstly if you see any place with placeholder image or text in the final build please dm me as this is a issue which has been missed by the team. 
Also, there are a few easter eggs on the website so try and find them.

Place Holder text is usually lorum ipsum

Place Holder Images are a grey Image with the word "Vpk" or "Eva" Or "WaterForest". These will be filled in soon and are there to make sure imagesd are correct and fit or there is no fitting image currently.





More Detail Soon..
